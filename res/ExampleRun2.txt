<------ Welcome to the Viking Battle ------>
This is a two player turn-based game where every player is assigned abilities at random and can pick the gear from the bag at random.
Players can also request a weapon from the armory which is assigned randomly. 
The Player with higher charisma dazzles their opponent and gets in the first strike.
The player who did not take a total damage greater than or equal to their health is declared the victor.
It is possible for a battle to end in a draw.
