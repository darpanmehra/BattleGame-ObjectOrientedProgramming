# Overview - Project 2 Battle

Turn-based battles generally start by pitting two players against one another. The battle begins by determining which player will go first and then proceeds as follows:

Players can pick a random set of 20 gears from a bag of gears. These gears affect the abilities of the player.

Player 1 attacks using the weapon that they have in hand by taking a swing at player 2 who tries to avoid the attack. If player 1 hits player 2, then player 2 potentially takes damage.
Player 2 attacks using the weapon that they have in hand by taking a swing at player 1 who tries to avoid the attack. If player 2 hits player 1, then player 1 potentially takes damage.
Turns continue back and forth until one of the players has taken total damage that is greater than or equal to their health.
The player who did not take total damage greater than or equal to their health is declared the victor. It is possible for a battle to end in a draw.

## List of Features
* Ability to create players in the battle with the basic abilities generated by rolling a die 4 times and choosing the best 3 values re-rolling the 1s.
* Ability to create gears of type HeadGear, Potion, Belts, Footwear
* Ability to create weapons of types Axes, Flails, Swords (Katanas, Two-handed, Broadswords).
* Ability to display the player's information regarding their basic abilities.
* Ability to generate a bag of gears with 25% of the gears negatively affecting the player.
* Ability to choose a list of 20 random gears and give it to each player.
* Ability to affect the abilities of the player after wearing the gears.
* Ability to not allow more than 1 headgear and footwear and more than 10 units of belts to each player.
* Ability to choose a weapon for the player and assign it.
* Ability to display the player's information regarding abilities, the gears they are wearing (in the order it's worn), the weapon they possess, their striking power, and their avoidance ability.
* Ability to choose who gets to attack first in the game. This is determined by the Charisma of the player. If both players have equal Charisma, then Player 1 gets to attack.
* Battle is fought in rounds. Max rounds are limited to 50 after which a draw is declared. 
* The round information is displayed after each round where the attacker & opponent, the weapon the attacker is using, the damage taken by the opponent, and the opponent's health are mentioned.
* The user gets a prompt to choose for a rematch. If a rematch is chosen, the players fight again in a new environment. 

## How To Run

Run the jar file.

```bash
cd /YourProjectDirectory/res
java -jar Project02-Battle.jar
```


## How to Use the Program

* Run the program using the command above.
* The program will start by creating a battle with 2 players
* generateGearBag() method will create a bag of gears and store it.
* Players will pick a random set of 20 gears from the gear bag
* A random weapon will be assigned to both players. This random weapon will determine the potential striking power and the attacking player
* Rounds will continue until we get a winner or else it will end in a draw after 50 rounds.
* User can ask for a rematch as keyboard input.

## Design/Model Changes
* Code duplication was occurring between different types of gears and weapons. Created an abstract class for both to avoid code duplication.
* Created a mock random generator implementation.


## Assumptions
* It is a two-player game and it cannot be extended.
* Bag of gear is static and it is produced at the beginning of every battle.
* Both players are equivalent in height, weight, other physical characteristics.
* 1 Katanas equals 1 pair of Katanas
* 1 Footwear equals 1 pair of Footwear
* Every Battle has a new environment. If the environment of the battle is the same, the chance of winning for a player increases. This creates biases in the game.
* Potion affects the strength of the player negatively by 2.
* HeadGear affects the constitution of the player by 15
* Footwear affects the Dexterity of the player by 7
* Belt affects the Strength of the player by 4.
* Belt affects the Constitution of the player depending on the size.
    1. Small size belts make the player uncomfortable and affects the Constitution negatively by 8
    2. Large-size belts make the player uncomfortable and affect the Constitution negatively by 5.
    3. Medium-size belts prove to be a good fit and help the player. Affects the Constitution positively by 4
* A random set of 20 bags are created and given to the player.  
* Match ends in a draw after 50 rounds.

## Limitations
* Java version 11 or more required.
